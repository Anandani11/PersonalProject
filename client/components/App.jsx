       It is a Sanskrit hindu term that means circle of light, we have many chakras however our body is composed out of 7 main chakras. Each chakra represents certain emotions which contribute to your quality of life and actions.

        <p>
          <p><b>Root Chakra know as the Muladhara</b></p>
          <p><b>Colour:</b> <font color="Red">Red</font></p>
          <p><b>Represents:</b> Your roots, stabiltiy and security</p>
          <p><b>Mantra/Sound:</b> LAM</p>
          <p><b>Element:</b> Earth</p>
          <p><b>Located:</b> This is your first chakra located at the bottom of your backbone tail</p>

          <p>This chakra would be the first chakra to work on as this represents your base, if you are not balanced and not grounded you will be all over the place. This chakra
     gives your stability and sense of security.</p>
